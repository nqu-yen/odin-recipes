    <p>These braised short ribs are pretty much foolproof. As long as two things happen, you are in for some very fine eats. First, the beef must be really well browned — I'm talking deep, dark, crusty, and caramelized. The other key step is easier. Just braise them until they're fork-tender. To paraphrase an expression, 'stick a fork in them, they're done.' After browning properly, the only way to mess these up is to undercook them, so don't.</p>
